== FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

= What is a CSV file? =

  CSV files or Comma Separated Value files are a simple text format for storing tabular data. A comma is used to separate characters, and also used to separate values in tables. When a comma is used for separating characters within a CSV file, it should be escaped with double quotes for proper structuring values in tables.

= What is CSV file format? =

  For WordPress, the default format will be UTF-8, and for non-Latin character data, UTF-8 without BOM is used. Various file formats are available based on encoding types like ANSI, UTF-8, UTF-8 without BOM, USC-2 BE BOM and USC-2 LE BOM.

= How to validate a CSV file for issues? =

  Importing your CSV may fail if you miss escaping characters or misplace/skip characters. Any CSV file should be checked for errors or warnings before being imported into WordPress. You can validate a CSV file using a free tool [CSV Lint](https://csvlint.io/) here to identify issues and where to fix them exactly.

= What is an XML file? =

  An XML document is a basic unit of XML information, consisting of elements and other markups in an orderly package. An XML document contains a wide variety of data.
